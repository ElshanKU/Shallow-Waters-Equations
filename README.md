# Shallow-Waters-Equations

Shallow water equations (SWE) modeling is the process of using mathematical and computational methods to simulate the behavior of shallow
water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. This technique is
widely used in various fields, including environmental science, civil engineering, and oceanography, to name a few. The goal of SWE modeling
is to understand the dynamics of water flow and predict future states
based on initial conditions and external influences. There are three primary approaches to SWE modeling: analytical, numerical, and hybrid
models. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice
of approach depends on the specific characteristics of the water body and
the modeling problem. Accurate SWE modeling can have a significant
impact on environmental management, disaster prevention, and infrastructure planning. It enables organizations to anticipate flooding events,
optimize water resource management, design effective flood control measures, and assess the impact of environmental changes on water bodies.
The dataset we worked on consists of different parameters that include
phic, hrain and alpha and other variables, for evaluating the performance
of different SWE models. For this project, we will be focusing on first
creating a proper dataset with uniformly randomly distributing the needed
parameters to get results for our rain, height and velocity. Furthermore,
to evaluate the performance of each model, we will use a range of metrics,
including (MAPE) and (MASE). Our goal is to develop a model that can
capture the patterns and correlations from the dataset that we created
and use it to predict the initial parameters we used.
